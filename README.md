`Use`
==========
All the code has been written in Python 3, though most parts would work in Python 2 as well (not tested).

If you discover some bugs or even worked out a way to fix them, that would be both exelent.

Currently 2 different data sources have been used:

* **jhu** - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 - Worldwide Data repository operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). 

* **csbs** - https://www.csbs.org/information-covid-19-coronavirus - U.S. County data that comes from the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.

__jhu__ data-source will be used as a default source if you don't specify a *source parameter* in your request.
